# Sports__Booking_App
Our IDP project - Please don't update on this repository ( just open it by following the first 4 minutes of this video - ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1fBfrcRMEs&amp;t=3s ) " you can access all files" , then using your visual studio just edit your specific files, after that you can send me the updated codes as word files on whatsapp OR by creating a new Github repository on your account ).

Until now we have 10 View ( divide them between Moustafa and Tahan ). all of them need UI edit except these 2 "MainTabbedView & ManageAppDataView". so 4 views to each one of you.

To login in as USER ====> username: Moustafa    , password : m

To login in as ADMIN ====> username: BBC Futsal Center    , password : 0000

For pages ( AdminBookingHistoryView  &  BookingHistoryView "this one done by Tahan, but I didnt add it to project yet" ) you need to run them directly from app.xaml.cs ( MainPage = new NAMEOFTHEPAGE(); ). Bcs they are not connected with binding data yet. 

For other pages you need to run the project and navigate to them, in order to see the view with data. 

Ignory backend messages appear in the screen of the app.
